# scRNAseq_analysis_OR_genes
Gene expression deconvolution and single cell sequencing analysis on Drosophila Melanogaster 

             
Analyzes the raw single cell count matrix, performs qc checks, 
normalizes the counts, performs PCA for dimensionality reduction,
performs leiden and louvain clustering with various neighborhood
and PC parameters, visualizes the final clusters, visualizes the human
annotated data, visualizes the target genes (differentially expressed OR genes)
